1
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:05,459
<i>Abraham.</i>

2
00:03:01,983 --> 00:03:03,283
- Lord...

3
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,721
here I am.

4
00:03:08,823 --> 00:03:11,224
<i>Take now your son...</i>

5
00:03:11,258 --> 00:03:15,530
your only son, Isaac
whom you love...

6
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:18,833
and go to the land
of Moriah.

7
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:22,570
And there, offer him,
as a burnt offering

8
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,739
on one of the mountains
I will tell you.

9
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:25,807
<i>Oh, Lord!</i>

10
00:03:27,742 --> 00:03:29,744
<i>No!</i>

11
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,746
<i>No!!!</i>

12
00:04:50,725 --> 00:04:52,760
Abraham?

13
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:54,796
<i>What are you doing,</i>
<i>Abraham?</i>

14
00:04:54,829 --> 00:04:57,665
All this commotion...
so early!

15
00:05:04,872 --> 00:05:06,040
Abraham?!

16
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,548
- The Lord's asked
for a sacrifice.

17
00:05:16,717 --> 00:05:20,054
- He has spoken
to you?

18
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,321
He hasn't done that
in years.

19
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,126
- I must go
to Moriah.

20
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:26,627
- Moriah?!

21
00:05:26,661 --> 00:05:28,596
It'll take two days'
to journey--

22
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,565
- It'll take three.

23
00:05:30,598 --> 00:05:33,067
- Why don't you build Him
an altar here...

24
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,903
as you did
in Shechem?

25
00:05:35,937 --> 00:05:37,104
As you did
in Hebron?

26
00:05:37,138 --> 00:05:39,540
- Because He says
Moriah.

27
00:05:39,574 --> 00:05:41,509
- But traipsing
across the wilderness,

28
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,442
as old as we are--

29
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:45,079
- Sarah!

30
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:47,715
It is not my decision
to make!

31
00:05:47,748 --> 00:05:51,118
The Lord has said
to go to Moriah.

32
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:52,653
Take your questions
to Him.

33
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:57,925
- When do we leave?

34
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,704
- Isaac and I
will go alone.

35
00:06:09,737 --> 00:06:11,739
<i>Isaac?</i>

36
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,107
Why Isaac?

37
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,909
Why not one
of the other men?

38
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,978
- Because the Lord
commands it...

39
00:06:17,011 --> 00:06:18,579
- You know how much
that troubles me.

40
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:22,550
- I know.

41
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,119
- The road is
a dangerous place, Abraham.

42
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:27,688
- The Lord has set us
on this path.

43
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:31,559
He will guide us...
regardless.

44
00:06:31,592 --> 00:06:34,862
- But still,
let me rest easy.

45
00:06:34,896 --> 00:06:36,931
take a few other men
with you.

46
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,084
- My lord!

47
00:06:57,118 --> 00:06:59,020
- Eliezer.

48
00:06:59,053 --> 00:07:00,087
- How are you
this morning?

49
00:07:02,924 --> 00:07:04,725
- The Lord came to me
last night.

50
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,660
- Truly?!

51
00:07:08,262 --> 00:07:10,564
- I haven't heard you
say those words in--

52
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,599
- In a long time...

53
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,068
- A very long time.

54
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:15,202
- I must go
to Moriah.

55
00:07:15,236 --> 00:07:16,237
- Moriah?

56
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,138
What reason?

57
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,776
- I must make a sacrifice
to Him there.

58
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,644
- Quite a distance
for a sacrifice.

59
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,713
- Sarah said
the same.

60
00:07:25,746 --> 00:07:26,881
She said I should
take a couple men

61
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,649
along with
Isaac and I.

62
00:07:28,683 --> 00:07:31,652
- Starting to worry about you
in your old age, huh, is she?

63
00:07:33,788 --> 00:07:35,990
- So...
who can you spare?

64
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,028
Kelzar!

65
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:44,765
- You know, you don't need
to volunteer your own son.

66
00:07:44,799 --> 00:07:46,167
- No, I don't,

67
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,203
but if I must stay here
and manage your house,

68
00:07:49,236 --> 00:07:52,506
at least let me send
my flesh and blood in my place.

69
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,042
Plus,
he's the best man I have.

70
00:07:55,076 --> 00:07:57,912
- All the more reason
for him to stay here.

71
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,181
You know, there is some truth
to Sarah's worries--

72
00:08:00,214 --> 00:08:03,551
the road can be...
unpredictable.

73
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:08,522
- Abraham...
you forget,

74
00:08:08,556 --> 00:08:11,692
since we first entered
this land decades ago,

75
00:08:11,726 --> 00:08:13,094
I have seen
the bounds of protection

76
00:08:13,127 --> 00:08:15,629
the Living God
has placed around you,

77
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,131
by your side.

78
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,233
There's no place safer
for my son to be.

79
00:08:21,135 --> 00:08:22,770
- Lord Abraham,
good morning!

80
00:08:22,803 --> 00:08:24,071
- Good morning,
son.

81
00:08:24,105 --> 00:08:25,806
- Yes, Father?

82
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,543
- The Lord called our master
to a short journey, to Moriah,

83
00:08:29,577 --> 00:08:31,078
to give a sacrifice
there.

84
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:33,748
I want you
to go with him...

85
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:34,648
if he allows.

86
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:38,252
- Of course.

87
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,754
- Take another one
of your men with you,

88
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:43,190
and ensure that our master
has everything he needs.

89
00:08:43,224 --> 00:08:44,558
- Yes, Father.

90
00:08:44,592 --> 00:08:46,694
When do we leave?

91
00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:47,862
- As soon as we can.

92
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,625
<i>- Father?</i>

93
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:21,328
- Is something
the matter?

94
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:27,368
- How is your morning,
my son?

95
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:30,738
- A young lamb slipped into
the narrow wash in the west end.

96
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:33,007
The other shepherds had
to lower me down on a line

97
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,975
to get her out.

98
00:09:35,009 --> 00:09:38,612
- They had to
lower <i>you</i> down?

99
00:09:38,646 --> 00:09:41,082
- Someone had
to do it...

100
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:42,216
why not me?

101
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:48,055
It set us back
a bit, but...

102
00:09:48,089 --> 00:09:50,925
we'll make up time
by day's end.

103
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,126
- Good.

104
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:55,996
- How about you,
Father?

105
00:09:58,032 --> 00:09:59,200
How is
your morning?

106
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,973
The Lord came to me
last night.

107
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:09,276
- What?

108
00:10:10,911 --> 00:10:13,013
The Lord God?!

109
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,083
- Yes.

110
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,820
- In a dream?!

111
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,992
- He stood
before me...

112
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:26,660
just as you stand
before me now.

113
00:10:30,764 --> 00:10:31,966
- What did He say?

114
00:10:34,335 --> 00:10:36,237
- He says we are to go
to Moriah, you and I...

115
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:40,741
and make a sacrifice
to Him there.

116
00:10:43,344 --> 00:10:44,278
- Moriah?

117
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:49,350
Where is that?

118
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:52,286
- North,
about a three-day walk.

119
00:10:55,956 --> 00:10:58,325
Pack a bag
and meet me at my tent.

120
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,426
We leave shortly.

121
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,227
- But my tasks--

122
00:11:00,261 --> 00:11:01,695
<i>- Eliezer</i>
<i>will see to them.</i>

123
00:11:16,744 --> 00:11:18,212
- Is everything
all right?

124
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:19,246
- Almost ready,

125
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,815
making the final
adjustments.

126
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,817
- Remind me your name.

127
00:11:23,851 --> 00:11:24,485
- Me?

128
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,320
Eshcolam.

129
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,055
- You're one
of the shepherds?

130
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,423
- I do what's needed,
what I'm told.

131
00:11:29,456 --> 00:11:30,858
I tend to their goats,
mostly.

132
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:34,695
- Sorry to keep you
waiting, Father.

133
00:11:36,531 --> 00:11:38,365
- Here.

134
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:42,970
- Are we ready?

135
00:11:43,003 --> 00:11:43,904
- Ready.

136
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,375
- All right...
let's move.

137
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,314
<i>Wait!</i>

138
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:54,248
Isaac!

139
00:11:56,016 --> 00:11:57,251
<i>Leaving without</i>
<i>kissing your mother?</i>

140
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:10,931
- Don't you leave without
telling your mother goodbye.

141
00:12:10,965 --> 00:12:11,932
Hmm?

142
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,938
Look after
your father.

143
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:20,241
He's not as young
as he used to be.

144
00:12:20,274 --> 00:12:23,844
- Ha, mistress,
my lord's hair may be gray,

145
00:12:23,877 --> 00:12:25,879
but his legs
are still strong.

146
00:12:25,913 --> 00:12:28,182
- I'll be the judge
of my husband's legs.

147
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,254
- Look after him.

148
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:37,391
- I will.

149
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:40,394
- Where have
the years gone?

150
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,830
- We should be
on our way.

151
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:43,764
- I know.

152
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,767
I know.

153
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,443
Where have
the years gone?

154
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,950
Make sure no harm
comes to our son.

155
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:12,026
- God is with us.

156
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:15,963
<i>- God is with us.</i>

157
00:13:52,266 --> 00:13:53,200
<i>Abram?</i>

158
00:13:57,304 --> 00:13:58,238
<i>Abram?!</i>

159
00:14:00,441 --> 00:14:01,975
- What's happened?!

160
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:04,512
What's wrong?!

161
00:14:06,581 --> 00:14:08,482
- What is it,
Abram?

162
00:14:08,516 --> 00:14:09,483
Are you harmed?!

163
00:14:11,686 --> 00:14:12,953
- What is it,
Abram?

164
00:14:14,656 --> 00:14:15,523
Abram!

165
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:20,260
- I...
uh...

166
00:14:20,294 --> 00:14:22,262
I saw...
God...

167
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,464
- You saw a god?

168
00:14:25,633 --> 00:14:27,535
- I saw God...

169
00:14:27,569 --> 00:14:29,637
The God.

170
00:14:29,671 --> 00:14:32,072
He appeared as a man
before me.

171
00:14:32,106 --> 00:14:33,073
He spoke to me.

172
00:14:33,107 --> 00:14:34,441
- What are you
saying?

173
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:40,180
- I must go to a land
He will show me.

174
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:41,482
- What?

175
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,587
For how long?

176
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,987
- For good.

177
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:55,195
- Abram...
our good name,

178
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,564
our home,

179
00:14:56,598 --> 00:14:57,632
our place
at the temple.

180
00:14:57,665 --> 00:15:00,434
- Everything
has changed.

181
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:03,505
I can no longer serve
the gods of my father.

182
00:15:03,538 --> 00:15:05,072
- This is blasphemy.

183
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,373
- You cannot
blaspheme a lie.

184
00:15:06,407 --> 00:15:07,709
- Abram,
don't say it--

185
00:15:07,742 --> 00:15:10,377
- He has promised to
make of me a great name...

186
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,446
a great nation,

187
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,648
that all the families
of the earth

188
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:15,416
will be blessed
through...

189
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:16,718
- A nation?

190
00:15:16,751 --> 00:15:17,619
We haven't
even a son.

191
00:15:17,652 --> 00:15:18,653
- We will.

192
00:15:18,686 --> 00:15:19,987
- How long
have we tried?

193
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,689
- He will provide.

194
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:25,560
He--He will
make a way.

195
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:29,564
- Abram, you don't
even know this God!

196
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:32,065
How do you know
this god is even good?!

197
00:15:32,099 --> 00:15:34,101
How do you know
He is even a god at all?

198
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:36,236
- Sarai...

199
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:38,573
He is.

200
00:15:38,606 --> 00:15:39,707
There is
no other God.

201
00:15:43,177 --> 00:15:44,546
- How do you know this,
Abram?!

202
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,315
- I know.

203
00:15:51,653 --> 00:15:52,953
I know.

204
00:15:54,522 --> 00:15:55,590
I know.

205
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,237
- Clear the path.

206
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:58,720
- Good day,
gentlemen.

207
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:02,489
Where are you
headed?

208
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,727
- We're going north.

209
00:17:07,595 --> 00:17:09,429
- I can see that...

210
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:11,198
Where?

211
00:17:11,231 --> 00:17:13,300
- Up beyond Hebron.

212
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,202
- There's a tribute
to be paid.

213
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:19,373
This road belongs to Abimelech,
King of Pelesheth.

214
00:17:19,406 --> 00:17:21,241
- I know who
owns this road.

215
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:23,578
I have given your king
plenty of tributes.

216
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:26,079
- Oh, you have?

217
00:17:26,113 --> 00:17:28,282
- Have you given a tithe
of those goods you carry there?

218
00:17:32,286 --> 00:17:34,288
- We carry nothing
of value...

219
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:37,090
- Come now, if you
have nothing of value,

220
00:17:37,124 --> 00:17:38,860
why carry it
at all?

221
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:39,861
- We have nothing!

222
00:17:39,894 --> 00:17:41,395
- Isaac!

223
00:17:41,428 --> 00:17:43,631
- Don't speak
out of turn, boy--

224
00:17:43,665 --> 00:17:46,300
your grandfather and I
are having a conversation...

225
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:47,735
- He is my father!

226
00:17:47,769 --> 00:17:48,736
- That's enough,
Isaac!

227
00:17:51,573 --> 00:17:53,106
<i>Nothing</i>
<i>but food and water...</i>

228
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:54,809
<i>Be sure</i>
<i>to check their persons.</i>

229
00:17:54,842 --> 00:17:57,177
- What is the purpose
of your travels?

230
00:17:57,210 --> 00:18:00,548
- I go to give a sacrifice
to the Lord God.

231
00:18:00,582 --> 00:18:01,583
- The Lord God?

232
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:05,787
- What is your name,
old man?

233
00:18:08,355 --> 00:18:09,289
- Abraham.

234
00:18:11,526 --> 00:18:13,493
- Once called Abram?

235
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:14,696
Of the Kasdim?

236
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:21,335
- The man who defeated
the kings of the east

237
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:24,471
and freed
the captives of Sodom...

238
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:27,407
all with an army
of shepherds?

239
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:29,711
- That was
a long time ago.

240
00:18:29,744 --> 00:18:31,613
- Our king
speaks highly of you.

241
00:18:33,948 --> 00:18:35,783
Mount up.

242
00:18:35,817 --> 00:18:36,684
We're losing
the light.

243
00:18:39,887 --> 00:18:42,890
- May your God
watch over you...

244
00:18:42,924 --> 00:18:44,726
the road holds
the unexpected.

245
00:18:46,761 --> 00:18:50,832
Beware of
the wild beasts...

246
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:52,232
careful the animals
as well.

247
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,818
- Seafaring dogs.

248
00:19:10,852 --> 00:19:12,887
- Those are my people.

249
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,322
- That's right...
I forgot.

250
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,860
<i>Well, next time</i>
<i>can you tell your people</i>

251
00:19:18,893 --> 00:19:20,662
not to scatter our supplies
all over the road?

252
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,636
<i>Praise be to God,</i>

253
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,170
He has delivered you
from that path.

254
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,174
<i>We should start camp</i>
<i>before it's full night.</i>

255
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,234
- Mm.

256
00:20:03,905 --> 00:20:04,806
These are good.

257
00:20:24,491 --> 00:20:25,760
- That horseman
today...

258
00:20:27,762 --> 00:20:30,531
he spoke of you
leading an army...

259
00:20:30,565 --> 00:20:31,799
When was this?

260
00:20:33,568 --> 00:20:35,937
<i>There was no army...</i>

261
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:38,039
<i>only herdsmen...</i>

262
00:20:38,072 --> 00:20:39,741
armed with whatever weapons
we could find.

263
00:20:42,744 --> 00:20:45,913
- And...
the power of God.

264
00:20:55,056 --> 00:20:56,758
- For what purpose?

265
00:20:56,791 --> 00:20:58,626
Why did you need to
save the Sodomites?

266
00:21:02,362 --> 00:21:04,932
- Kings from Shinar
in the east

267
00:21:04,966 --> 00:21:07,635
had come up against the kings
of Sodom, Gomorrah

268
00:21:07,668 --> 00:21:09,704
and their
surrounding cities.

269
00:21:11,906 --> 00:21:14,041
They pillaged
all they could find

270
00:21:14,075 --> 00:21:15,643
and took those
left there captive.

271
00:21:18,679 --> 00:21:20,782
They made it beyond Damascus
before we could reach them.

272
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,954
I had family
among the captives...

273
00:21:26,988 --> 00:21:28,455
So I did
what I had to do.

274
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:36,998
- My father's
rarely spoken of this.

275
00:21:37,031 --> 00:21:38,331
- I know.

276
00:21:41,736 --> 00:21:44,539
- To travel
that far...

277
00:21:44,572 --> 00:21:46,541
putting your life
on the line...

278
00:21:46,574 --> 00:21:48,976
rescuing all
those people...

279
00:21:49,010 --> 00:21:53,548
only to have them burn
with their cities later.

280
00:21:53,581 --> 00:21:54,982
You must have felt your efforts
were for nothing.

281
00:22:13,134 --> 00:22:17,572
- The people of Sodom were
deeply wicked and depraved.

282
00:22:25,513 --> 00:22:28,883
<i>We are</i>
<i>no different...</i>

283
00:22:28,916 --> 00:22:30,718
when we go
our own way.

284
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:19,033
<i>Abram.</i>

285
00:23:21,102 --> 00:23:22,570
- Lord!

286
00:23:40,621 --> 00:23:43,991
<i>To your descendants...</i>

287
00:23:44,025 --> 00:23:45,192
<i>I will give</i>
<i>this land.</i>

288
00:24:16,157 --> 00:24:19,827
<i>Count the stars</i>
<i>if you are able.</i>

289
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,963
<i>So shall</i>
<i>your descendants be.</i>

290
00:24:39,647 --> 00:24:40,247
<i>- Father...</i>

291
00:24:42,183 --> 00:24:43,651
<i>Father!</i>

292
00:24:43,684 --> 00:24:45,586
Father.

293
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,021
The sun is risen.

294
00:25:58,259 --> 00:25:59,560
- It's late.

295
00:26:05,199 --> 00:26:06,634
- Behold your
inheritance...

296
00:26:09,837 --> 00:26:11,806
...a dead land.

297
00:26:16,277 --> 00:26:17,678
Your flocks
are starving.

298
00:26:20,081 --> 00:26:21,949
Your people will
soon starve as well.

299
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,288
What now,
Abram?

300
00:26:31,058 --> 00:26:31,926
Hmm?

301
00:26:33,227 --> 00:26:39,867
This--this God has lead you
right into a famine.

302
00:26:53,214 --> 00:26:55,049
- The Lord
has made a promise...

303
00:27:01,956 --> 00:27:03,991
- My time has come upon me
once again.

304
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:11,332
So not only has He lead you
to a barren land...

305
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:14,268
He has made your wife
to be barren as well.

306
00:27:20,241 --> 00:27:22,810
We can't stay here.

307
00:27:22,843 --> 00:27:24,778
We need to go
back home...

308
00:27:24,812 --> 00:27:28,849
- No...
no turning back.

309
00:27:28,883 --> 00:27:30,050
- Then what,
Abram?!

310
00:27:40,194 --> 00:27:41,996
- I have heard
from the women here

311
00:27:42,029 --> 00:27:44,899
that many of them
are going to Egypt.

312
00:27:44,932 --> 00:27:47,935
The river is full
and the land, fertile.

313
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:52,973
Maybe we should
go there as well.

314
00:28:28,008 --> 00:28:30,945
- So, Esh...

315
00:28:30,978 --> 00:28:32,379
you think your mother's
faring well without you?

316
00:28:35,115 --> 00:28:37,384
- I suppose.

317
00:28:37,418 --> 00:28:39,987
The northern flock
was just sheared.

318
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,822
She's so busy,

319
00:28:41,855 --> 00:28:43,157
she may not have
even noticed I've gone.

320
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:46,927
How 'bout
your mother?

321
00:28:52,366 --> 00:28:57,238
- I'm certain she fares
better than any of us...

322
00:28:57,271 --> 00:28:58,405
being now
in the Lord's presence.

323
00:29:00,874 --> 00:29:03,210
- Oh, that's right.

324
00:29:03,244 --> 00:29:06,046
I forgot.

325
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,314
- That's all right.

326
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:13,320
Your mother,
however...

327
00:29:13,354 --> 00:29:15,256
she's probably in a <i>living hell</i>
with you gone.

328
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:39,913
- What's happened here?

329
00:29:42,082 --> 00:29:43,217
- Who would leave
all this behind?

330
00:29:47,522 --> 00:29:48,556
- That doesn't
belong to us.

331
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:52,527
- What a waste.

332
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:55,530
- We should
get moving.

333
00:29:55,563 --> 00:29:57,164
- There's
someone here!

334
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:58,132
- Isaac, wait!

335
00:29:59,233 --> 00:30:00,234
- Sir?!

336
00:30:00,267 --> 00:30:01,869
Sir,
what happened?!

337
00:30:01,902 --> 00:30:03,203
Who did this
to you?

338
00:30:03,237 --> 00:30:04,471
- They took
my daughter.

339
00:30:04,506 --> 00:30:05,540
He's bled out
a lot!

340
00:30:05,573 --> 00:30:06,840
- We should load him
into his cart

341
00:30:06,874 --> 00:30:07,941
and take him
back to Hebron.

342
00:30:07,975 --> 00:30:11,078
- Th-they... took...
my daugh-ter.

343
00:30:11,111 --> 00:30:12,046
- What?

344
00:30:12,079 --> 00:30:13,113
Who's they?

345
00:30:13,147 --> 00:30:14,481
The men.

346
00:30:14,516 --> 00:30:15,482
- What men?

347
00:30:15,517 --> 00:30:18,085
What men?

348
00:30:18,118 --> 00:30:19,521
What men?

349
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:20,789
What men?!

350
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:53,887
<i>Who could have</i>
<i>done this?</i>

351
00:30:57,157 --> 00:30:58,225
- The horsemen.

352
00:31:00,227 --> 00:31:02,229
- From yesterday?

353
00:31:02,262 --> 00:31:04,398
- How can
you be so sure?!

354
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:05,366
- What do we do
with him?

355
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:08,636
- Nothing.

356
00:31:11,138 --> 00:31:14,007
- Shouldn't we
bury him?

357
00:31:14,041 --> 00:31:16,176
- What for?

358
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:20,682
For him to lie
in an unknown grave?

359
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:24,084
If he's buried,
he's forgotten.

360
00:31:24,118 --> 00:31:26,186
If he's left here
by the road,

361
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,323
he stands
as a witness...

362
00:31:29,356 --> 00:31:31,358
a witness to the depth
of which mankind has fallen.

363
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:26,714
Is that Hebron?

364
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,519
Yes.

365
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,288
- That's Hebron.

366
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,481
- We going in?

367
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:03,718
- Now.

368
00:33:38,418 --> 00:33:40,522
- What are you doing?

369
00:33:43,156 --> 00:33:45,760
- Praying...

370
00:34:01,141 --> 00:34:02,577
- Wait!

371
00:34:09,717 --> 00:34:12,486
- We don't pray
like this anymore,

372
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,621
like the old ways.

373
00:34:14,789 --> 00:34:18,191
We pray to
The Lord Most High...

374
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,461
not to stones or the stars
or the moon...

375
00:34:21,495 --> 00:34:25,098
- I do pray to Him...

376
00:34:25,132 --> 00:34:27,669
and I pray
to Him...

377
00:34:27,702 --> 00:34:31,839
and I pray
to Him...

378
00:34:31,873 --> 00:34:33,575
...just as you said
we should.

379
00:34:38,312 --> 00:34:40,582
But why doesn't He
hear me?

380
00:34:40,615 --> 00:34:42,650
- He hears you.

381
00:34:42,684 --> 00:34:45,352
He does.

382
00:34:45,385 --> 00:34:46,588
- It's been
ten years...

383
00:34:51,726 --> 00:34:55,128
ten years...
since we left home.

384
00:34:59,901 --> 00:35:02,737
You say--

385
00:35:02,770 --> 00:35:05,439
you say
He promised us land...

386
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:11,111
yet we haven't even a plot
to our name.

387
00:35:14,716 --> 00:35:20,588
You said He promised us
descendants;

388
00:35:20,622 --> 00:35:26,493
yet here I am,
still barren...

389
00:35:26,527 --> 00:35:28,328
and aging.

390
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:30,263
- The Lord
will provide.

391
00:35:30,297 --> 00:35:32,432
- When, Abram?!

392
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:33,433
When?

393
00:35:38,673 --> 00:35:39,807
- When <i>He</i> wills.

394
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:59,226
- You cannot
have a nation...

395
00:35:59,259 --> 00:36:02,262
if you cannot
even have a son.

396
00:36:43,037 --> 00:36:46,641
How much longer?

397
00:36:46,674 --> 00:36:48,375
How much longer,
Lord?

398
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,393
<i>Do not</i>
<i>be afraid, Abram.</i>

399
00:37:11,331 --> 00:37:14,669
<i>I AM your shield...</i>

400
00:37:14,702 --> 00:37:17,437
<i>your exceedingly</i>
<i>great reward.</i>

401
00:37:17,471 --> 00:37:20,608
- Lord God,
what will You give me,

402
00:37:20,641 --> 00:37:22,409
seeing I remain
childless?

403
00:37:25,713 --> 00:37:30,317
And the heir of my house
is Eliezer of Damascus.

404
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:32,720
You have given me
no offspring.

405
00:37:32,754 --> 00:37:34,555
A <i>servant</i> in my house
is my heir.

406
00:37:35,623 --> 00:37:36,858
[coughing}

407
00:37:36,891 --> 00:37:40,027
A <i>servant</i> in my house
is my heir.

408
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:57,011
<i>This servant</i>
<i>shall not be your heir...</i>

409
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:04,351
<i>but one who will come</i>
<i>from your own body</i>

410
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:07,320
shall be your heir.

411
00:38:48,428 --> 00:38:50,131
- Some men
are approaching.

412
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:51,498
Prepare the tent.

413
00:38:56,403 --> 00:38:59,807
Turn aside men,
come.

414
00:38:59,841 --> 00:39:01,642
I have beauties
for all your tastes.

415
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,078
Come!

416
00:39:04,111 --> 00:39:05,478
Anything you want,

417
00:39:05,513 --> 00:39:07,515
I have it,
I have it!

418
00:39:07,548 --> 00:39:08,583
If these are not
to your liking,

419
00:39:08,616 --> 00:39:10,618
I have even more
in my city!

420
00:39:10,651 --> 00:39:11,853
Relax,
you deserve it!

421
00:39:12,987 --> 00:39:15,488
Or not.

422
00:39:15,523 --> 00:39:16,757
Whatever you want!

423
00:39:16,791 --> 00:39:18,425
Whatever you wish!

424
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,961
Satisfy
your desires.

425
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:23,998
<i>Keep to the path.</i>

426
00:39:26,567 --> 00:39:27,568
- Come!

427
00:39:27,602 --> 00:39:31,005
Whatever you wish,
I have.

428
00:39:31,038 --> 00:39:33,507
He who is weary,
will find rest here!

429
00:39:43,483 --> 00:39:45,753
<i>It's different</i>
<i>than I remember it.</i>

430
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:48,022
- You lived
in Hebron?

431
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,857
<i>We all did.</i>

432
00:39:49,891 --> 00:39:51,726
That was before
Isaac's time.

433
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:58,799
I was actually
born there.

434
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:00,534
- Was Ishmael
born there as well?

435
00:40:06,874 --> 00:40:08,910
- Yes...

436
00:40:08,943 --> 00:40:10,044
he was born there
as too.

437
00:40:41,108 --> 00:40:42,543
- Sarai!

438
00:40:42,576 --> 00:40:43,244
- What?

439
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,012
What on earth?

440
00:40:46,747 --> 00:40:49,750
- The Lord came to me!

441
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:52,219
- Hagar, bring a bowl
of water!

442
00:40:52,253 --> 00:40:53,821
- Are you hurt?!

443
00:40:53,854 --> 00:40:54,989
- No.

444
00:40:55,022 --> 00:40:56,123
- Where have you been?

445
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:57,725
It's been
over a day.

446
00:40:57,758 --> 00:40:58,960
- With the Lord.

447
00:40:58,993 --> 00:41:00,695
He came to me.

448
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:03,197
First, in a vision
and then here in this tent.

449
00:41:03,230 --> 00:41:04,598
- What?

450
00:41:06,133 --> 00:41:08,269
- Then He took me out
into the night.

451
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:09,670
- Mistress...

452
00:41:09,704 --> 00:41:12,139
- Place it
on the table.

453
00:41:12,173 --> 00:41:13,975
- And?

454
00:41:14,008 --> 00:41:16,944
- He says--He says
He will give me descendants

455
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,212
as numerous
as the stars!

456
00:41:18,245 --> 00:41:20,214
- My lord...

457
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:21,682
- I'll take care
of it.

458
00:41:25,186 --> 00:41:26,620
- Here, sit.

459
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:34,895
When I woke yesterday,
I looked everywhere for you.

460
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:39,667
Before long,
I began to panic.

461
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,135
- I'm sorry.

462
00:41:41,168 --> 00:41:42,203
- I thought
the Mesopotamians

463
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:44,839
had come
in retaliation

464
00:41:44,872 --> 00:41:46,807
and taken you
from me.

465
00:41:46,841 --> 00:41:47,875
- I should
have told you.

466
00:41:47,908 --> 00:41:49,744
I'm sorry.

467
00:41:49,777 --> 00:41:52,613
- Finally,
I found Eliezer.

468
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:57,752
He said you had taken a heifer
and some livestock.

469
00:41:57,785 --> 00:42:00,287
- Yes, yes,
the Lord has--

470
00:42:00,321 --> 00:42:02,023
- Required
a sacrifice?

471
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:04,959
- No.

472
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:07,161
He has made
a covenant...

473
00:42:07,194 --> 00:42:09,130
the promise of descendants
and this land.

474
00:42:09,163 --> 00:42:12,033
- Abram,
I heard this before.

475
00:42:12,066 --> 00:42:14,135
- No, but now
there's more.

476
00:42:14,168 --> 00:42:15,703
The Lord has made
a covenant.

477
00:42:15,736 --> 00:42:16,871
It cannot
be broken.

478
00:42:19,673 --> 00:42:21,709
- Well, how does He intend
to bring this to pass?

479
00:42:21,742 --> 00:42:22,777
Through the line
of Eliezer?

480
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:30,184
- Eliezer of Damascus
will no longer need be my heir.

481
00:42:33,687 --> 00:42:37,291
The Lord has said that my heir
will come from my own body.

482
00:42:39,994 --> 00:42:40,928
- <i>Your</i> body.

483
00:42:40,961 --> 00:42:42,163
- Yes.

484
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:44,799
- <i>Your</i> body.

485
00:42:50,738 --> 00:42:57,378
I am like a dry seed
in the summer sun...

486
00:42:57,411 --> 00:42:59,346
I can bear you
no heir.

487
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:02,183
- No...
the Lord has said--

488
00:43:02,216 --> 00:43:06,954
- The Lord has said He will
make a nation of <i>you</i> ...

489
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:09,156
give <i>you</i>
descendants...

490
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,659
give <i>you</i>
an heir...

491
00:43:11,692 --> 00:43:13,627
of <i>your</i> body...

492
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:16,030
not mine.

493
00:43:16,063 --> 00:43:16,964
- No.

494
00:43:18,999 --> 00:43:20,768
- Yes.

495
00:43:20,801 --> 00:43:23,904
For ten years--
for ten years

496
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:25,406
He has promised this.

497
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,807
I understand now.

498
00:43:29,143 --> 00:43:30,377
I understand.

499
00:43:34,915 --> 00:43:36,784
If the Lord
has restrained me

500
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:37,852
from bearing children...

501
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:47,027
go into my maid, Hagar,
the Egyptian.

502
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:48,195
- Why would you
say that?

503
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:52,266
- Perhaps through her
I'll bear children.

504
00:43:52,299 --> 00:43:53,367
- No, I can't!

505
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,902
I can't go
and lie with--

506
00:43:54,935 --> 00:43:58,372
- Abram, noble men back home
do the same.

507
00:44:01,242 --> 00:44:03,244
- But this can't
be the Lord's plan.

508
00:44:06,347 --> 00:44:10,384
- When He first
came to you in Ur,

509
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:14,255
He told you to
leave your country.

510
00:44:14,288 --> 00:44:19,293
He told you to
leave your family, hmm?

511
00:44:19,326 --> 00:44:23,397
Maybe all along...

512
00:44:23,430 --> 00:44:26,700
you needed
to have left me.

513
00:44:26,734 --> 00:44:27,735
- No.

514
00:44:31,105 --> 00:44:33,107
Sarai--

515
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:35,809
- Husband,
He has a plan for you.

516
00:44:35,843 --> 00:44:38,312
- Sarai.

517
00:44:38,345 --> 00:44:40,781
- I will not
stand in your way.

518
00:44:40,814 --> 00:44:42,082
- You're not standing
in the way of that.

519
00:44:44,018 --> 00:44:46,954
You're standing
by my side.

520
00:44:46,987 --> 00:44:48,722
You're my wife.

521
00:44:48,756 --> 00:44:50,391
- Yes...

522
00:44:50,424 --> 00:44:51,825
now, let me be
a <i>good</i> wife.

523
00:45:42,577 --> 00:45:45,879
- We'll stop there
and make camp.

524
00:45:45,913 --> 00:45:47,948
I'll gather wood and kindling
for the fire.

525
00:45:47,982 --> 00:45:49,517
- Why don't you
have Esh do that?

526
00:45:49,551 --> 00:45:50,985
- No.

527
00:45:51,018 --> 00:45:53,187
We need to be unpacked
before we lose the light.

528
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,122
- Yes, right.

529
00:45:55,155 --> 00:45:57,925
- We can use some of the wood
we already have.

530
00:45:57,958 --> 00:45:59,460
- No.

531
00:45:59,493 --> 00:46:03,130
We'll need
all of it...

532
00:46:03,163 --> 00:46:05,232
for tomorrow.

533
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:33,827
- Father!

534
00:46:35,963 --> 00:46:39,133
It's only me.

535
00:46:39,166 --> 00:46:41,869
- This place is sprawling
with wolf tracks.

536
00:46:41,902 --> 00:46:44,071
Should we move camp?

537
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:50,244
- No; they'll fear the light,
once the fire's lit.

538
00:46:50,277 --> 00:46:52,046
- They're nearly
all set,

539
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:56,618
so I thought I'd come
and give you a hand.

540
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:58,352
- All right.

541
00:46:58,385 --> 00:47:01,855
tie this bundle.

542
00:47:01,889 --> 00:47:03,424
Get the fire started
before we're in the dark.

543
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:18,405
- My lord.

544
00:47:20,341 --> 00:47:21,543
May I ask you
a question?

545
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:27,881
Why is the Lord having you
trek all this way

546
00:47:27,915 --> 00:47:29,316
for a sacrifice?

547
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,522
- I don't know.

548
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:37,358
- You don't know?!

549
00:47:39,527 --> 00:47:41,061
- Well, if sacrifices
earn greater favor,

550
00:47:41,095 --> 00:47:42,262
then you're sure
to gain--

551
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:44,932
- The Lord's favor
is not earned.

552
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:47,067
- But...
how can you say that,

553
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:50,471
when, clearly,
you've earned it yourself?

554
00:47:50,505 --> 00:47:51,573
- I have <i>earned</i>
nothing.

555
00:47:53,708 --> 00:47:57,612
One who thinks he can stand
before the Most High God

556
00:47:57,645 --> 00:48:00,948
and offer his own filthy,
feeble deeds as a bargain...

557
00:48:00,981 --> 00:48:04,418
is blind to
the holiness of God,

558
00:48:04,451 --> 00:48:08,288
and blind to the depths
of his own sin.

559
00:48:08,322 --> 00:48:10,324
- Blind...

560
00:48:10,357 --> 00:48:12,459
So am I blind?

561
00:48:12,493 --> 00:48:14,228
<i>Esh!</i>

562
00:48:14,261 --> 00:48:16,330
- Everyone's blind...

563
00:48:16,363 --> 00:48:19,133
until their eyes
are opened.

564
00:48:19,166 --> 00:48:20,602
- Is that
some sort of riddle?

565
00:48:26,508 --> 00:48:29,410
- If the Lord God
stands infinitely holy...

566
00:48:29,443 --> 00:48:30,310
then any sin

567
00:48:30,344 --> 00:48:33,548
must pit us infinitely
opposed to Him.

568
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:38,385
How can a man
bridge such a chasm?

569
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:42,222
We are lost at sea
paddling into the wind...

570
00:48:42,256 --> 00:48:43,725
until the Lord
<i>comes to us</i> ...

571
00:48:43,758 --> 00:48:45,159
<i>He</i> makes the way.

572
00:48:47,261 --> 00:48:49,697
I gave sacrifice
after sacrifice

573
00:48:49,731 --> 00:48:52,032
in the temples of the gods
of my fathers...

574
00:48:52,065 --> 00:48:54,702
thinking I was
nearing the divine.

575
00:48:54,736 --> 00:48:56,236
But all of it,

576
00:48:56,270 --> 00:48:57,672
all that effort,

577
00:48:57,705 --> 00:48:58,740
all those rites
and rituals,

578
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:01,241
all I was doing was--

579
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:03,043
was paddling
into the wind.

580
00:49:03,076 --> 00:49:05,112
- You were sacrificing
to the wrong gods.

581
00:49:05,145 --> 00:49:07,414
- False gods.

582
00:49:07,448 --> 00:49:11,519
But even if I were sacrificing
in the name of the Lord,

583
00:49:11,553 --> 00:49:17,224
my faith was placed in
my own abilities, not His--

584
00:49:17,257 --> 00:49:18,593
<i>how much</i>
I <i>could give,</i>

585
00:49:18,626 --> 00:49:20,562
how much
<i>I</i> could do.

586
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:22,564
I believed
I could--

587
00:49:22,597 --> 00:49:25,700
I believed
I could...

588
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:29,637
right my own wrongs.

589
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:31,539
But,
in spite of it all,

590
00:49:31,573 --> 00:49:33,106
in spite of
all I'd done...

591
00:49:33,140 --> 00:49:36,544
in spite of myself,

592
00:49:36,578 --> 00:49:40,447
while on my way to serve
those demons I called gods,

593
00:49:40,481 --> 00:49:44,184
the Lord Himself
came to me.

594
00:49:44,218 --> 00:49:46,487
He appeared
before me.

595
00:49:46,521 --> 00:49:51,458
And--and in an instant,
I was undone.

596
00:49:56,230 --> 00:49:58,600
When I saw Him,

597
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:01,703
I saw myself
for who I really was--

598
00:50:01,736 --> 00:50:06,073
worthless,
apart from His grace.

599
00:50:06,106 --> 00:50:07,307
- Your eyes were opened.

600
00:50:11,311 --> 00:50:14,081
- Then why
all this way?

601
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:15,683
Why go
all this way?

602
00:50:15,717 --> 00:50:17,351
Go through
all this effort?

603
00:50:17,384 --> 00:50:20,588
- Because this is
what the Lord commands.

604
00:50:20,622 --> 00:50:24,358
- If He's the One
who makes the way,

605
00:50:24,391 --> 00:50:26,193
why would He
require sacrifices?

606
00:50:39,206 --> 00:50:43,343
- I suppose...

607
00:50:43,377 --> 00:50:47,582
He has us do this
in remembrance,

608
00:50:47,615 --> 00:50:49,751
as a reminder.

609
00:50:49,784 --> 00:50:52,452
- To remind us
of what?

610
00:50:52,486 --> 00:50:57,190
- That death
is the penalty for sin.

611
00:50:57,224 --> 00:51:00,862
- But how is
that not--?

612
00:51:00,895 --> 00:51:02,262
As you make
sacrifices,

613
00:51:02,296 --> 00:51:03,798
you are,
yourself,

614
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:05,800
making payments
for the sins you've done,

615
00:51:05,833 --> 00:51:08,570
righting
your own wrongs.

616
00:51:08,603 --> 00:51:11,138
The death you say
He requires...

617
00:51:11,171 --> 00:51:13,440
<i>it is a life</i>
<i>for a life.</i>

618
00:51:13,473 --> 00:51:16,811
<i>How does the life</i>
<i>of an animal</i>

619
00:51:16,844 --> 00:51:18,378
measure up to
that of a man?

620
00:51:23,183 --> 00:51:24,251
- It cannot.

621
00:51:26,721 --> 00:51:28,188
- Then why journey
all this way,

622
00:51:28,221 --> 00:51:29,389
if only
for some symbol;

623
00:51:29,423 --> 00:51:32,259
if that's
all it is?

624
00:51:32,292 --> 00:51:34,127
<i>Esh,</i>

625
00:51:34,161 --> 00:51:35,495
that's enough
belaboring.

626
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:40,568
- Who can know
the mind of God,

627
00:51:40,602 --> 00:51:43,337
His ways,
His thoughts?

628
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,406
He has His reason
for commanding a sacrifice,

629
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:49,343
be it a symbol,
or a memorial,

630
00:51:49,376 --> 00:51:56,383
whatever the purpose,
the Lord knows...

631
00:51:56,416 --> 00:51:57,484
and it must be good.

632
00:52:00,253 --> 00:52:01,556
- You believe that?

633
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,461
- I must believe that.

634
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:16,303
- I don't know,
to trek <i>so</i> far...

635
00:52:16,336 --> 00:52:19,172
seems more like some act
of penance for some great sin.

636
00:52:43,931 --> 00:52:46,567
- She shall be a wife
to you as well.

637
00:53:39,687 --> 00:53:41,689
- Lord have mercy.

638
00:54:51,959 --> 00:54:56,631
- Oh, Lord...

639
00:54:56,664 --> 00:55:00,333
my sin has been great
before You, I know.

640
00:55:03,004 --> 00:55:06,073
And if this is
Your retribution,

641
00:55:06,107 --> 00:55:06,974
it is just.

642
00:55:13,548 --> 00:55:17,384
But Lord God,
I beg You...

643
00:55:17,417 --> 00:55:18,886
I beg You
for Your mercy.

644
00:55:23,524 --> 00:55:31,464
Do not let my sins
be on my son's head...

645
00:55:31,498 --> 00:55:33,568
the son
You promised.

646
00:55:37,939 --> 00:55:39,707
What's Your purpose
in this?

647
00:55:42,743 --> 00:55:45,913
If this is
Your judgment on me...

648
00:55:45,947 --> 00:55:48,115
then take my life,
not his.

649
00:55:51,586 --> 00:55:54,789
Take <i>my</i> life,
not his.

650
00:55:54,822 --> 00:55:57,592
Not his, Lord;
take me.

651
00:55:57,625 --> 00:55:59,160
Take me.

652
00:55:59,193 --> 00:56:00,862
Take me!

653
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:02,830
Take me!!

654
00:56:10,470 --> 00:56:14,141
Lord, I lay--I lay
my life down at Your feet.

655
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:16,744
It is Yours.

656
00:56:16,777 --> 00:56:19,446
Please hear me,
Lord.

657
00:56:19,479 --> 00:56:20,480
Please grant me this,

658
00:56:20,514 --> 00:56:24,151
by Your grace,
Lord, please...

659
00:56:24,185 --> 00:56:25,686
please.

660
00:56:29,824 --> 00:56:31,092
Please hear me.

661
00:56:32,894 --> 00:56:36,130
Please.

662
00:56:36,163 --> 00:56:39,600
Please.

663
00:58:47,762 --> 00:58:50,164
- Your brazenness
last night...

664
00:58:50,197 --> 00:58:51,565
is unacceptable.

665
00:58:54,635 --> 00:58:57,038
You will
show him respect.

666
00:58:57,071 --> 00:58:59,874
- Just as he shows respect
to me and my people?

667
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:01,575
- Esh...

668
00:59:01,609 --> 00:59:02,877
he's right
when he tells you

669
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:04,345
that you're better off
in his house

670
00:59:04,378 --> 00:59:06,247
than with those people.

671
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:08,015
They're ruthless
and wicked.

672
00:59:08,049 --> 00:59:09,884
- So I should drop down
and kiss his feet

673
00:59:09,917 --> 00:59:12,353
for giving me the honor
of being his slave?

674
00:59:12,386 --> 00:59:14,121
- Much better to be a slave
to the righteous

675
00:59:14,155 --> 00:59:15,956
than a slave
to the wicked.

676
00:59:15,990 --> 00:59:17,258
- Righteous?

677
00:59:17,291 --> 00:59:18,959
Are you
delusional?

678
00:59:18,993 --> 00:59:21,862
Or is your flattery
only because of your position?

679
00:59:21,896 --> 00:59:23,631
- What position?

680
00:59:23,664 --> 00:59:26,867
- You're the son
of the chief servant.

681
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:29,904
Do you not see how
advantageous your situation is?

682
00:59:29,937 --> 00:59:32,239
- I love my master.

683
00:59:32,273 --> 00:59:35,009
- With Ishmael and his mother,
Hagar, banished,

684
00:59:35,042 --> 00:59:38,379
if anything
were to befall Isaac,

685
00:59:38,412 --> 00:59:41,082
His inheritance would revert
back to your father,

686
00:59:41,115 --> 00:59:42,049
back to you.

687
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:44,919
- No.

688
00:59:44,952 --> 00:59:46,187
- Oh, so this <i>has</i>
crossed your mind.

689
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,722
- Stop.

690
00:59:50,658 --> 00:59:51,826
Isaac is
my friend.

691
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:54,295
- And Ishmael
was mine!

692
00:59:54,328 --> 00:59:57,064
- You've given the devil
a foothold in your mind.

693
00:59:57,098 --> 01:00:00,000
Shut your mouth
and put away those thoughts.

694
01:00:02,002 --> 01:00:03,404
- Think of your progeny.

695
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:06,273
How else will they be
anything more than slaves?

696
01:00:06,307 --> 01:00:09,043
- That's enough!

697
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:12,046
Don't give me a reason to
bring a report to my father.

698
01:00:18,786 --> 01:00:20,955
- Your master's not
as righteous as you claim...

699
01:01:21,782 --> 01:01:23,050
- Sarai?

700
01:01:24,818 --> 01:01:25,953
What's wrong?

701
01:01:27,288 --> 01:01:28,455
- Everything is wrong.

702
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,328
- What?

703
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:37,164
- Don't play ignorant
with me!

704
01:01:37,198 --> 01:01:39,967
I have followed you
all these years.

705
01:01:42,970 --> 01:01:47,808
I have clung to you
through every trial,

706
01:01:47,841 --> 01:01:49,143
every day,

707
01:01:49,176 --> 01:01:51,045
every week,

708
01:01:51,078 --> 01:01:55,082
every month,
year after year...

709
01:01:55,115 --> 01:01:59,787
waiting for what you claimed
the Lord has promised.

710
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:05,059
And now,
after all this...

711
01:02:05,092 --> 01:02:07,461
what do I have?

712
01:02:07,494 --> 01:02:10,064
Hmm?

713
01:02:10,097 --> 01:02:13,767
A husband that
I must share...

714
01:02:13,801 --> 01:02:15,302
a bed that
has been stained...

715
01:02:18,305 --> 01:02:20,007
and a hope that
has faded away.

716
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,308
No.

717
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:24,812
No!

718
01:02:24,845 --> 01:02:28,215
Don't act like
you care for me!

719
01:02:28,249 --> 01:02:30,417
It's you!

720
01:02:30,451 --> 01:02:31,385
- It's your fault!

721
01:02:31,418 --> 01:02:33,087
All of this
is your fault!

722
01:02:33,120 --> 01:02:34,421
Your fault;
it's all I have.

723
01:02:37,258 --> 01:02:38,392
No...

724
01:02:38,425 --> 01:02:41,028
I'm such a fool.

725
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:43,197
- I'm sorry.

726
01:02:43,230 --> 01:02:46,233
I'm so sorry
for this long-suffering.

727
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:49,136
We must believe the Lord's
working something in it all.

728
01:02:49,169 --> 01:02:51,539
Look at me.

729
01:02:51,573 --> 01:02:54,241
We must cling
to our faith.

730
01:02:54,275 --> 01:02:56,544
- As you did...

731
01:02:56,578 --> 01:02:58,879
when you went
into my handmaiden?

732
01:03:01,516 --> 01:03:03,484
- You gave her to me.

733
01:03:03,518 --> 01:03:05,085
I protested.

734
01:03:05,119 --> 01:03:06,854
- You protested?!

735
01:03:06,887 --> 01:03:08,590
- Yes.

736
01:03:08,623 --> 01:03:12,126
- The child in her belly
would say otherwise!

737
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,160
- You suggested that.

738
01:03:15,362 --> 01:03:21,168
- I was a wife striving
to please her husband!

739
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:24,972
Seeing the disappointment
in your eyes,

740
01:03:25,005 --> 01:03:31,011
month after month,
year after year.

741
01:03:31,045 --> 01:03:33,581
It broke me,
Abram.

742
01:03:33,615 --> 01:03:36,950
I was broken.

743
01:03:36,984 --> 01:03:40,988
So in weakness,

744
01:03:41,021 --> 01:03:47,294
I gave my maid
into your embrace.

745
01:03:47,328 --> 01:03:51,465
But <i>you--</i>
you embraced her!

746
01:03:51,498 --> 01:03:53,400
<i>You</i> took her!

747
01:03:53,434 --> 01:03:56,370
<i>You</i> laid with her!

748
01:03:56,403 --> 01:03:59,873
You! You!

749
01:03:59,907 --> 01:04:03,177
And now that she
has conceived,

750
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:07,481
I am disgraceful
in her eyes--

751
01:04:07,515 --> 01:04:10,484
walking around like
this is <i>her</i> household.

752
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:17,358
I hear the whispers.

753
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:20,961
The way she looks
at you.

754
01:04:20,994 --> 01:04:22,597
The way she looks
at me.

755
01:04:22,630 --> 01:04:27,167
She vies for my place.

756
01:04:27,201 --> 01:04:28,369
And she has it.

757
01:04:28,402 --> 01:04:29,269
- No.

758
01:04:29,303 --> 01:04:30,304
- Yes!

759
01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:31,271
- No, she doesn't
have it.

760
01:04:31,305 --> 01:04:34,007
- You may have
your heir,

761
01:04:34,041 --> 01:04:37,579
you may have
your nation,

762
01:04:37,612 --> 01:04:40,914
you may have
everything.

763
01:04:40,948 --> 01:04:43,350
But know this...

764
01:04:43,384 --> 01:04:48,355
your house now stands
divided, Abram.

765
01:04:48,389 --> 01:04:50,023
And it's on you,
Abram.

766
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:56,230
Let the Lord be the Judge
between you and I.

767
01:04:56,263 --> 01:04:57,599
- Listen to me.

768
01:04:57,632 --> 01:05:00,467
My wife, I--
I--

769
01:05:00,501 --> 01:05:03,404
- You what?

770
01:05:03,437 --> 01:05:06,073
- She does not
have your place...

771
01:05:06,106 --> 01:05:08,275
If there's
any contention,

772
01:05:08,308 --> 01:05:10,043
do with her
as you will.

773
01:05:10,077 --> 01:05:12,079
Hagar is your maid.

774
01:05:12,112 --> 01:05:15,916
- Do not preach to me
about faith any longer.

775
01:05:22,657 --> 01:05:23,957
<i>Is today the day?</i>

776
01:05:25,325 --> 01:05:26,694
- Hmm?

777
01:05:26,728 --> 01:05:28,295
- We'll make it
to Moriah today?

778
01:05:30,565 --> 01:05:31,432
Yes.

779
01:05:34,435 --> 01:05:36,036
We'll make it
to Moriah today.

780
01:05:42,677 --> 01:05:43,578
<i>Beautiful.</i>

781
01:05:46,280 --> 01:05:48,482
<i>How can the Lord be so good--</i>
<i>as to give us all this?</i>

782
01:05:51,118 --> 01:05:53,053
What can we ever give
in return?

783
01:06:00,394 --> 01:06:01,529
- We should
be on our way.

784
01:06:04,097 --> 01:06:05,365
- Father?!

785
01:06:08,435 --> 01:06:09,637
What have I done?

786
01:06:13,541 --> 01:06:14,642
- You have
done nothing.

787
01:06:17,077 --> 01:06:19,246
- Your silence and separation
these past few days...

788
01:06:22,382 --> 01:06:23,585
what is it?

789
01:06:26,788 --> 01:06:28,255
- Sometimes...

790
01:06:32,259 --> 01:06:34,428
sometimes the Lord calls us
to great tasks...

791
01:06:37,565 --> 01:06:38,700
impossible tasks.

792
01:06:46,173 --> 01:06:48,008
- Is anything too difficult
for the Lord?

793
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:55,349
- No.

794
01:06:55,382 --> 01:06:58,085
No, my son...
no.

795
01:06:58,118 --> 01:06:59,721
<i>All's loaded</i>
<i>and ready, my lord!</i>

796
01:07:58,646 --> 01:08:00,848
Is this it?

797
01:08:00,882 --> 01:08:01,749
This is Ephrathah.

798
01:08:26,206 --> 01:08:27,642
- I have never
noticed that before.

799
01:08:30,545 --> 01:08:32,680
Is that from your time
in Egypt?

800
01:08:32,714 --> 01:08:34,381
<i>No...</i>

801
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:35,583
these aren't
Egyptian.

802
01:08:39,453 --> 01:08:41,355
- What does it say?

803
01:08:41,388 --> 01:08:43,290
- I don't know.

804
01:08:43,323 --> 01:08:45,258
This was
my father's staff.

805
01:08:45,292 --> 01:08:46,928
It was his father's
before him,

806
01:08:46,961 --> 01:08:50,665
His father's before him,
and so on,

807
01:08:50,698 --> 01:08:53,400
It's a language
now forgotten, I suppose.

808
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,469
- I never knew that.

809
01:08:55,502 --> 01:08:57,772
- And some day
he'll hand it down to you.

810
01:08:59,674 --> 01:09:00,808
<i>May I see it?</i>

811
01:09:09,784 --> 01:09:11,151
Wow.

812
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:17,424
This is amazing.

813
01:09:24,431 --> 01:09:27,167
- One more thing
for you to inherit.

814
01:09:35,375 --> 01:09:38,780
- These last days
on the road,

815
01:09:38,813 --> 01:09:41,516
a question has
lingered in my mind.

816
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,452
If you were willing
to save <i>wicked</i> Sodomites

817
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:48,956
from the hands of foreign kings
all those years ago...

818
01:09:48,990 --> 01:09:50,591
why do you hold
such a bitter disdain

819
01:09:50,625 --> 01:09:54,529
for the Pelishtiy,
<i>my</i> people, today?

820
01:09:54,562 --> 01:09:56,329
<i>I do not disdain them.</i>

821
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:57,832
- Then why are you so quick
to belittle them,

822
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:59,000
and so quick
to blame them

823
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:01,368
for the murder of that man
on the road?

824
01:10:01,401 --> 01:10:03,671
- I disdain
their deeds--

825
01:10:03,705 --> 01:10:05,907
and I blame them
for that man's murder...

826
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:08,241
and for the robbing
of his daughter,

827
01:10:08,275 --> 01:10:10,410
because it <i>is</i> like them
to do such a thing.

828
01:10:10,444 --> 01:10:12,245
- Oh, it's like them
to do so?

829
01:10:12,279 --> 01:10:13,280
- Yes.

830
01:10:13,313 --> 01:10:14,347
- And how
do you know this?

831
01:10:16,884 --> 01:10:18,318
- Because they
once took my wife.

832
01:10:21,055 --> 01:10:25,593
They placed her in the harem
of Abimelech their king.

833
01:10:25,626 --> 01:10:28,730
But the Lord plagued
his house and his people.

834
01:10:28,763 --> 01:10:29,931
So when he found out
she was my wife,

835
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:31,666
he gave her back--

836
01:10:31,699 --> 01:10:35,670
along with wealth and servants
as repayment.

837
01:10:35,703 --> 01:10:37,505
And so you and your mother
entered into my household.

838
01:10:40,908 --> 01:10:42,610
Praise God Abimelech
hadn't yet lain with her.

839
01:10:45,947 --> 01:10:47,582
- That still doesn't prove
that <i>that</i> man's daughter

840
01:10:47,615 --> 01:10:49,650
was taken
by men of Pelesheth.

841
01:10:49,684 --> 01:10:50,450
- No,
it doesn't,

842
01:10:50,484 --> 01:10:53,821
but the odds
are in their favor.

843
01:10:53,855 --> 01:10:57,658
Wicked kings are renowned
for storing up stolen women.

844
01:10:57,692 --> 01:11:00,393
Ask your mother
if she would disagree.

845
01:11:00,427 --> 01:11:02,997
Ultimately, however,
in this world,

846
01:11:03,030 --> 01:11:04,832
all men are capable
of such evil.

847
01:11:04,866 --> 01:11:05,933
- Even you?

848
01:11:05,967 --> 01:11:07,702
- Yes, even me.

849
01:11:07,735 --> 01:11:09,937
Apart from
my God's grace,

850
01:11:09,971 --> 01:11:11,639
<i>all</i> men are capable
of much worse.

851
01:11:15,342 --> 01:11:17,712
Praise God that
He has delivered you out

852
01:11:17,745 --> 01:11:20,615
from under
such taskmasters.

853
01:11:20,648 --> 01:11:23,350
- You pride yourself
on being a safe haven

854
01:11:23,383 --> 01:11:24,886
for <i>pagan</i> refugees?

855
01:11:24,919 --> 01:11:26,821
- Pride myself?

856
01:11:26,854 --> 01:11:29,624
If I can point man
back to his Creator...

857
01:11:29,657 --> 01:11:31,659
then to God
be the glory.

858
01:11:31,692 --> 01:11:34,762
- Point man
back to his Creator.

859
01:11:34,796 --> 01:11:36,396
Is that
what you were doing

860
01:11:36,429 --> 01:11:38,099
when you banished your own son
with his Egyptian mother?

861
01:11:38,132 --> 01:11:39,834
- Eshcolam!

862
01:11:39,867 --> 01:11:42,670
My father will hear
of your insolence!

863
01:11:42,703 --> 01:11:46,007
- It's all right.

864
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:48,375
I'd rather answer
his question

865
01:11:48,408 --> 01:11:50,545
and bring truth
to light

866
01:11:50,578 --> 01:11:52,312
than allow animosity
to fester.

867
01:11:59,153 --> 01:12:01,454
When Isaac
was very young,

868
01:12:01,488 --> 01:12:06,928
Ishmael's scoffing towards him
became too much to bear.

869
01:12:06,961 --> 01:12:11,732
We had seen the same contention
in his mother years before.

870
01:12:11,766 --> 01:12:14,001
Eventually, the Lord had said
to send them away.

871
01:12:14,035 --> 01:12:15,002
- The Lord said.

872
01:12:17,104 --> 01:12:19,874
- It brought me
great pain...

873
01:12:19,907 --> 01:12:21,742
but the Lord says

874
01:12:21,776 --> 01:12:25,513
He will make a great nation
of him as my seed...

875
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:28,115
and that 12 princes
will come from his line.

876
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:29,984
- Does that help
settle your conscience?

877
01:12:30,017 --> 01:12:31,384
- Get out!

878
01:12:31,418 --> 01:12:32,452
- I'm not finished!

879
01:12:32,485 --> 01:12:34,121
- Yes, you are!

880
01:12:34,155 --> 01:12:37,925
- You give yourself license
to do whatever you wish

881
01:12:37,959 --> 01:12:40,695
as long as you can say,
"the Lord has said!"

882
01:12:40,728 --> 01:12:41,929
Bastardize
your son--

883
01:12:41,963 --> 01:12:42,897
<i>Kelzar, wait.</i>

884
01:12:42,930 --> 01:12:44,532
<i>--enslave</i>
<i>whoever you wish,</i>

885
01:12:44,565 --> 01:12:45,566
<i>Kelzar!</i>

886
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,068
mutilate the men
of your house!

887
01:12:47,101 --> 01:12:48,069
- Wait!

888
01:12:48,102 --> 01:12:49,670
- I know
your intentions!

889
01:12:49,704 --> 01:12:52,874
You come plant yourself here
in my homeland

890
01:12:52,907 --> 01:12:57,410
and seek to build a slave army
to overthrow my people!

891
01:12:57,444 --> 01:12:59,013
You think you deserve
this land?!

892
01:12:59,046 --> 01:13:02,049
- No...

893
01:13:02,083 --> 01:13:04,585
no;
neither do you.

894
01:13:07,955 --> 01:13:09,557
What man deserves
any good thing in this world?

895
01:13:12,059 --> 01:13:13,694
- You expect me
to praise your God

896
01:13:13,728 --> 01:13:16,197
for giving me the privilege
of being your slave...

897
01:13:16,230 --> 01:13:18,065
<i>...O master</i>
<i>of righteousness</i> ?!

898
01:13:18,099 --> 01:13:19,800
- That's it!

899
01:13:19,834 --> 01:13:21,969
I'm going to bring you
back home by a rope!

900
01:13:22,003 --> 01:13:22,904
Isaac,
grab the vine.

901
01:13:24,572 --> 01:13:26,774
- What torments you,
Abraham?!

902
01:13:26,807 --> 01:13:28,843
Take your hands
off me!

903
01:13:28,876 --> 01:13:30,778
Tell us what
you're hiding!

904
01:13:30,811 --> 01:13:32,113
What you scream of
at night!

905
01:13:36,117 --> 01:13:37,084
Ahh!

906
01:13:41,122 --> 01:13:42,023
- This is my land!

907
01:14:24,832 --> 01:14:26,200
Well done, old man.

908
01:14:28,669 --> 01:14:30,503
Seems our
warrior shepherd

909
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:32,573
is still one to be
reckoned with...

910
01:14:32,606 --> 01:14:35,776
even in the twilight
of his years!

911
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:39,981
Abram
of the Kasdim.

912
01:14:40,014 --> 01:14:42,083
- Abraham.

913
01:14:42,116 --> 01:14:46,587
- Having a bit
of a scuffle, are we?

914
01:14:46,620 --> 01:14:49,857
You know, you shouldn't charge
your master like that.

915
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,060
Especially one known
to conquer kings.

916
01:14:53,094 --> 01:14:54,862
You'll be fortunate

917
01:14:54,895 --> 01:14:56,197
if he doesn't
put you to death for it.

918
01:14:59,834 --> 01:15:02,236
<i>It's only</i>
<i>a misunderstanding.</i>

919
01:15:02,269 --> 01:15:04,705
<i>If I'm not mistaken,</i>

920
01:15:04,739 --> 01:15:07,942
<i>you were headed</i>
<i>to Hebron.</i>

921
01:15:07,975 --> 01:15:10,811
Did you miss it?

922
01:15:10,845 --> 01:15:13,581
It's a day's walk
back <i>that</i> way.

923
01:15:13,614 --> 01:15:16,150
- "Beyond Hebron"
is what I said.

924
01:15:16,183 --> 01:15:18,619
- Beyond...
certainly <i>well</i> beyond.

925
01:15:22,223 --> 01:15:24,158
If you were
more truthful,

926
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,926
I would've been
more intentional

927
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:27,762
about collecting
a tithe

928
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:31,032
for the extent of which
you used my king's road.

929
01:15:31,065 --> 01:15:33,701
- Looks to me like you've
taken enough "tithes" already!

930
01:15:33,734 --> 01:15:35,903
- Isaac,
quiet yourself!

931
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:37,605
- Looks to me
you need a lesson

932
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:39,306
in speaking
out of turn, boy.

933
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:41,842
- We are far
from the coast.

934
01:15:41,876 --> 01:15:44,779
Abimelech has no territory
this far into Canaan.

935
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:47,715
- Our king
is a man of ambition.

936
01:15:47,748 --> 01:15:48,716
- And since when
does tithing

937
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:50,851
require robbing a poor father
of his daughter?

938
01:15:59,193 --> 01:16:03,130
- You speak of what
you do not know, boy.

939
01:16:03,164 --> 01:16:04,331
- Put your sword away.

940
01:16:04,365 --> 01:16:05,966
You can take
whatever you want.

941
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,201
- I know exactly
of what I speak...

942
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:12,640
a man slain
on the road,

943
01:16:12,673 --> 01:16:14,775
whose dying lips only spoke
of his stolen daughter.

944
01:16:14,809 --> 01:16:15,743
- Isaac!

945
01:16:16,844 --> 01:16:18,279
<i>You snakes!</i>

946
01:16:18,312 --> 01:16:21,282
You think you can flee the
condemnation that awaits you?!

947
01:16:21,315 --> 01:16:23,818
- Come to me.

948
01:16:23,851 --> 01:16:28,289
I will give your flesh
to the birds of the air

949
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:31,058
and the beasts
of the field.

950
01:16:31,092 --> 01:16:32,660
- Let the girl go!

951
01:16:32,693 --> 01:16:35,362
- We've come only to sacrifice
to the Lord God!

952
01:16:35,396 --> 01:16:39,333
Take what you want;
we'll be on our way!

953
01:16:39,366 --> 01:16:41,735
- How about I take <i>you</i>
as a tithe?

954
01:16:41,769 --> 01:16:42,870
- You will not!

955
01:16:48,742 --> 01:16:50,010
- So be it.

956
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:59,753
My life...
for hers.

957
01:16:59,787 --> 01:17:02,256
<i>She's used goods</i>
<i>now anyway.</i>

958
01:17:04,959 --> 01:17:06,894
We can make him
an effeminate!

959
01:17:06,927 --> 01:17:09,130
- Many in the court
will love that!

960
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:12,399
- You will do
nothing...

961
01:17:12,433 --> 01:17:13,300
other than leave
right now!

962
01:17:14,835 --> 01:17:15,903
- Stop!

963
01:17:19,907 --> 01:17:21,876
How about I cut a tenth
of your son's body...

964
01:17:24,378 --> 01:17:26,180
we'll call it
a day?

965
01:17:27,448 --> 01:17:30,818
- My son
speaks the truth.

966
01:17:30,851 --> 01:17:33,921
You cannot escape the eternal
torment that awaits you.

967
01:17:33,954 --> 01:17:35,756
The road
you're on now

968
01:17:35,789 --> 01:17:37,391
will only lead
to fire and flame.

969
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:38,993
Now,
let go of my son!

970
01:17:40,261 --> 01:17:41,962
- Isaac!

971
01:17:41,996 --> 01:17:42,897
- Watch out!

972
01:17:54,742 --> 01:17:58,245
<i>Do not preach to me</i>
<i>about faith any longer.</i>

973
01:18:04,084 --> 01:18:09,089
If all your hopes were
dashed upon the rock...

974
01:18:09,123 --> 01:18:14,161
and all that you loved
was lost...

975
01:18:14,195 --> 01:18:18,032
would <i>your</i> faith
still stand?

976
01:18:18,065 --> 01:18:20,701
Or would you curse God
to His face?

977
01:18:31,212 --> 01:18:32,313
<i>Should I hide</i>

978
01:18:32,346 --> 01:18:34,348
<i>what I am about to do</i>
<i>from Abraham?</i>

979
01:18:40,254 --> 01:18:41,755
<i>For I have chosen him,</i>

980
01:18:44,825 --> 01:18:47,194
<i>so that he will</i>
<i>command his children</i>

981
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:49,830
<i>and his house</i>
<i>after him,</i>

982
01:18:49,863 --> 01:18:51,398
<i>to keep the way</i>
<i>of the LORD.</i>

983
01:18:54,168 --> 01:18:56,937
<i>This is how the LORD</i>
<i>will fulfill to Abraham</i>

984
01:18:56,971 --> 01:18:59,240
<i>what He promised him.</i>

985
01:19:08,983 --> 01:19:11,218
<i>Get away from him!</i>

986
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:12,820
<i>Don't touch him!</i>

987
01:19:12,853 --> 01:19:14,288
<i>Captain!</i>

988
01:19:14,321 --> 01:19:16,223
<i>The king will have your head</i>
<i>if he gets word of this!</i>

989
01:19:16,257 --> 01:19:17,791
<i>You must leave now!</i>

990
01:19:17,825 --> 01:19:18,859
<i>It's not worth it!</i>

991
01:19:22,530 --> 01:19:24,298
<i>Saddle her up.</i>

992
01:19:24,331 --> 01:19:25,399
<i>Let's go...</i>

993
01:19:27,535 --> 01:19:28,502
<i>I'll leave them</i>
<i>for the vultures.</i>

994
01:19:32,106 --> 01:19:34,842
<i>I am God Almighty.</i>

995
01:19:34,875 --> 01:19:37,211
<i>Walk before Me</i>
<i>and be blameless.</i>

996
01:19:46,854 --> 01:19:48,022
<i>My Lord!</i>

997
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:52,493
Isaac!

998
01:19:54,962 --> 01:19:56,997
<i>No longer</i>
<i>shall you be called Abram.</i>

999
01:19:59,867 --> 01:20:03,337
<i>Abraham shall</i>
<i>be your name.</i>

1000
01:20:03,370 --> 01:20:06,473
<i>For I have made you</i>
<i>a "Father of many nations."</i>

1001
01:20:10,344 --> 01:20:12,313
<i>As for your wife,</i>

1002
01:20:12,346 --> 01:20:15,382
<i>no longer shall</i>
<i>you call her Sarai.</i>

1003
01:20:15,416 --> 01:20:18,152
<i>Sarah shall be</i>
<i>her name.</i>

1004
01:20:18,185 --> 01:20:21,556
<i>She shall be</i>
<i>the mother of nations.</i>

1005
01:20:21,589 --> 01:20:26,293
<i>Kings of peoples</i>
<i>shall be from her.</i>

1006
01:20:26,327 --> 01:20:29,430
<i>I will bless her</i>
<i>indeed.</i>

1007
01:20:29,463 --> 01:20:32,399
<i>Your wife, Sarah,</i>

1008
01:20:32,433 --> 01:20:35,002
<i>will bear you a son,</i>

1009
01:20:35,035 --> 01:20:36,970
<i>and you shall</i>
<i>call his name--</i>

1010
01:20:37,004 --> 01:20:38,038
<i>Father!!</i>

1011
01:20:38,072 --> 01:20:39,273
<i>--Isaac.</i>

1012
01:20:39,306 --> 01:20:40,542
- Father,
are you all right?!

1013
01:20:43,977 --> 01:20:46,313
<i>I will confirm</i>
<i>my covenant with</i> him...

1014
01:20:50,084 --> 01:20:52,019
<i>as a</i> permanent
<i>covenant.</i>

1015
01:20:56,090 --> 01:20:57,458
- I'm all right,
my son;

1016
01:20:59,661 --> 01:21:00,894
I'm all right.

1017
01:21:47,709 --> 01:21:51,646
<i>Are you all right...</i>
<i>my love?</i>

1018
01:21:53,981 --> 01:21:55,182
<i>Are you all right?</i>

1019
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:12,700
Sarah?

1020
01:22:26,581 --> 01:22:31,318
- I feel... there's a child
growing in my belly.

1021
01:22:38,626 --> 01:22:39,727
- Are you certain?!

1022
01:22:45,533 --> 01:22:48,368
- It's impossible!

1023
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:49,970
Who would believe it?!

1024
01:22:53,373 --> 01:22:56,343
- Is anything too difficult
for the Lord?

1025
01:23:36,483 --> 01:23:38,653
- We'll go up
and worship;

1026
01:23:38,686 --> 01:23:40,053
then come back
to you.

1027
01:24:10,652 --> 01:24:20,260
- My mother...
and my father...

1028
01:24:20,294 --> 01:24:28,502
devoted their lives
to the gods of Damascus--

1029
01:24:28,536 --> 01:24:33,808
striving to earn favor
from wood and stone.

1030
01:24:40,782 --> 01:24:45,820
Then one day,

1031
01:24:45,853 --> 01:24:50,725
<i>that</i> man
entered their city.

1032
01:24:54,161 --> 01:24:56,864
Where would I be
without him?

1033
01:24:56,898 --> 01:24:58,533
Where would
my mother be?

1034
01:25:05,607 --> 01:25:09,844
When all of the world
went wicked,

1035
01:25:09,877 --> 01:25:15,783
the Lord chose that man
out from the wicked,

1036
01:25:15,817 --> 01:25:18,519
that hope
may endure.

1037
01:25:38,238 --> 01:25:40,407
<i>My Lord Abraham!</i>

1038
01:25:40,440 --> 01:25:41,576
<i>Father?</i>

1039
01:25:41,609 --> 01:25:44,579
- I'm here,
my son.

1040
01:25:44,612 --> 01:25:46,413
- We have the fire,
the wood...

1041
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:50,718
but... where's the lamb
for the burnt offering?

1042
01:25:50,752 --> 01:25:51,886
<i>Your son!</i>

1043
01:25:51,919 --> 01:25:52,787
<i>Your son is here!</i>

1044
01:26:01,663 --> 01:26:03,497
<i>God Himself</i>

1045
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:05,365
will provide a lamb
for the burnt offering.

1046
01:26:29,256 --> 01:26:30,525
<i>There...</i>

1047
01:27:11,498 --> 01:27:12,600
- The wood, now.

1048
01:27:34,522 --> 01:27:35,857
I don't deserve this.

1049
01:27:39,627 --> 01:27:41,729
God
is so good to us.

1050
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,334
He keeps
His promises.

1051
01:27:53,941 --> 01:27:56,010
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1052
01:27:59,647 --> 01:28:01,314
- Forgive me.

1053
01:28:03,416 --> 01:28:04,886
- For what?

1054
01:28:08,856 --> 01:28:12,994
- The Lord has said--

1055
01:28:13,027 --> 01:28:15,395
the Lord has said for <i>you</i>
to be the sacrifice.

1056
01:28:17,598 --> 01:28:18,666
- What?

1057
01:28:20,968 --> 01:28:22,603
Wh-why?

1058
01:28:22,637 --> 01:28:23,871
- I don't know.

1059
01:28:23,905 --> 01:28:26,339
- Ask Him.

1060
01:28:26,373 --> 01:28:27,474
Speak to Him;

1061
01:28:27,508 --> 01:28:28,976
perhaps there's
another way.

1062
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:30,678
- I did!

1063
01:28:30,711 --> 01:28:32,647
Every night
as I lie awake!

1064
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:34,481
Every moment
of our journey!

1065
01:28:34,515 --> 01:28:36,818
Every step
toward this place,

1066
01:28:36,851 --> 01:28:40,922
this has been
my heart's constant cry.

1067
01:28:40,955 --> 01:28:43,624
Silence has been
His only answer.

1068
01:28:43,658 --> 01:28:44,826
- Have I done wrong?

1069
01:28:44,859 --> 01:28:49,396
- No... no.

1070
01:28:49,429 --> 01:28:52,432
You have done
no wrong in my eyes.

1071
01:28:52,465 --> 01:28:55,468
- Am I not the son
He intended for you?

1072
01:28:55,502 --> 01:28:56,904
- You are!

1073
01:28:56,938 --> 01:28:58,973
You are
the son of promise.

1074
01:28:59,006 --> 01:29:02,143
He has promised
a great nation through you...

1075
01:29:02,176 --> 01:29:03,778
you, Isaac;

1076
01:29:03,811 --> 01:29:06,914
He has called you
by name.

1077
01:29:06,948 --> 01:29:08,415
- Why then
must you kill me?

1078
01:29:10,417 --> 01:29:12,520
- I don't know.

1079
01:29:12,553 --> 01:29:14,689
I don't know.

1080
01:29:14,722 --> 01:29:17,658
Whatever He's doing
in all this...

1081
01:29:17,692 --> 01:29:19,794
whatever He's
trying to teach...

1082
01:29:19,827 --> 01:29:22,096
whatever He's
trying to show...

1083
01:29:22,129 --> 01:29:24,665
I'm lost.

1084
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:28,035
I begged for Him to let me
lay my own self down...

1085
01:29:31,138 --> 01:29:32,573
but that's not
what He's asked for.

1086
01:29:36,476 --> 01:29:40,114
So, now--

1087
01:29:40,147 --> 01:29:44,819
now, I must
lay down my son,

1088
01:29:44,852 --> 01:29:47,487
my only son,
whom I love.

1089
01:29:47,521 --> 01:29:51,025
And we must have faith
that our God,

1090
01:29:51,058 --> 01:29:54,128
the giver and the taker
of life...

1091
01:29:54,161 --> 01:29:59,066
has the power to give life
once again.

1092
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,001
I believe that.

1093
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:05,673
Look at me.

1094
01:30:05,706 --> 01:30:07,975
I know that.

1095
01:30:08,009 --> 01:30:09,076
I know that.

1096
01:30:12,179 --> 01:30:14,048
- As do I.

1097
01:30:19,787 --> 01:30:21,088
I don't want this.

1098
01:30:24,225 --> 01:30:28,396
But...
not my will...

1099
01:30:35,002 --> 01:30:36,137
let His be done.

1100
01:31:40,735 --> 01:31:43,170
- Give me the strength
to do Your will.

1101
01:32:15,169 --> 01:32:16,170
<i>Abraham!</i>

1102
01:32:16,203 --> 01:32:17,838
<i>Abraham!</i>

1103
01:32:17,872 --> 01:32:19,707
- Here I am.

1104
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,709
Here I am, Lord.

1105
01:32:21,742 --> 01:32:24,712
<i>Do not lay a hand</i>
<i>on the young man.</i>

1106
01:32:24,745 --> 01:32:26,113
<i>Do nothing to him.</i>

1107
01:32:32,887 --> 01:32:35,890
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>that you fear God...</i>

1108
01:32:35,923 --> 01:32:38,292
since you have not
withheld your son,

1109
01:32:38,325 --> 01:32:41,162
your only son,
from Me.

1110
01:32:41,195 --> 01:32:42,129
- What's happened?!

1111
01:32:43,964 --> 01:32:46,600
- He has spared you!

1112
01:32:46,634 --> 01:32:48,335
The Lord
has spared you!

1113
01:33:02,817 --> 01:33:03,951
A substitute.

1114
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:31,078
The Lord will provide
in this place.

1115
01:33:31,112 --> 01:33:34,915
Here...
in the Mount of the LORD

1116
01:33:34,949 --> 01:33:36,317
it shall be provided.

1117
01:33:41,255 --> 01:33:44,024
<i>By Myself</i>
<i>I have sworn.</i>

1118
01:33:44,058 --> 01:33:47,094
<i>Because you have not</i>
<i>withheld your son,</i>

1119
01:33:47,128 --> 01:33:49,997
<i>your</i> only <i>son,</i>

1120
01:33:50,030 --> 01:33:52,266
<i>in your seed</i>

1121
01:33:52,299 --> 01:33:57,238
<i>all the nations of the earth</i>
<i>shall be blessed...</i>

1122
01:34:37,278 --> 01:34:43,417
- Truly,
this Man was...

1123
01:34:43,450 --> 01:34:45,085
the Son of God.
